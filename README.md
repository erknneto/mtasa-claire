# **üî∞ MTA:SA - Claire Anticheat**

Claire is a modular anticheat system for MTA:SA, designed to help improve the overall quality and fairness of multiplayer servers. The idea is simple: organize detections into clean, independent modules, make the system easy to configure, and open it up so more people can contribute.

The project started as a collaboration between a few developers ‚Äî combining real server experience with support from AI to speed up development and keep things structured. From the start, the goal has been to build something useful not just for one server, but for the wider MTA community.

Claire is still in active development. It's not perfect ‚Äî and it doesn‚Äôt try to be. But it‚Äôs open-source, easy to extend, and built with long-term maintainability in mind. Contributions, feedback, and constructive criticism are not only welcome, but essential to make this project better over time.

If you're running an MTA:SA server and looking for a solid base to start protecting it, Claire might be a good starting point.

# **‚ùì Why does it matter?**
Cheating has become increasingly common in MTA:SA, and there's a growing need for servers to protect themselves in a reliable and sustainable way. Claire was created to address that ‚Äî not as a closed or private solution, but as something open to everyone.

By being fully open-source, Claire gives server owners an accessible and transparent tool to detect common exploits and improve their server environment. But more than that, it invites collaboration. The idea is that, together ‚Äî through testing, feedback, improvements, and shared knowledge ‚Äî we can create a more solid, trustworthy anticheat system that benefits the entire MTA community.

Security should not be a luxury or a mystery. It should be something we build together.
