# **üî∞ MTA:SA - Claire Anticheat**

Claire is a modular, lightweight anticheat system for MTA:SA, designed to improve the integrity and fairness of multiplayer servers. Its core philosophy is simple: organize detections into clean, independent modules, make them easy to configure, and build an open platform that others can expand and improve.

Claire runs silently in the background, acting as a guardian layer ‚Äî constantly monitoring player behavior, network conditions, and client-side integrity without interfering with gameplay or degrading performance. Its design favors discretion and precision, targeting cheats without disrupting legitimate users.

If you're looking for a solid, customizable foundation to secure your MTA:SA server, Claire is ready to help.

# **‚ùì Why does it matter?**
Cheating has become increasingly common in MTA:SA, and there's a growing need for servers to protect themselves in a reliable and sustainable way. Claire was created to address that ‚Äî not as a closed or private solution, but as something open to everyone. By being fully open-source, Claire gives server owners an accessible and transparent tool to detect common exploits and improve their server environment. But more than that, it invites collaboration. The idea is that, together ‚Äî through testing, feedback, improvements, and shared knowledge ‚Äî we can create a more solid, trustworthy anticheat system that benefits the entire MTA community.

# **üõ°Ô∏è Current features**

Claire currently includes over 20 independent detection modules, covering movement, combat, environment manipulation, network spoofing, and more. All detections are modular, configurable, and designed to operate silently in the background with minimal performance impact. False positives are rare thanks to tolerance-based logic, score systems, and heuristic analysis. Overall reliability across all modules is around 95%, based on extensive stress simulations and edge case testing.

Below is a full list of current features and their real-world reliability:
